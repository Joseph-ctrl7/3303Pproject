Classes: 

Elevator - This class is controlled by the ElevatorSubsystem. It handles movements such as turning on lamps(button pressed or direction lamps), opening/closing of elevator door and going up or down.

ElevatorSubsystem - This class manages sending and receiving of requests from the scheduler and notifies the Elevator class to perform specific tasks.

Floor - This class is controlled by the Floorsubsystem. It handles floor requests and it has it's specific floor number, car button and floor lamps. 

FloorSubsystem- This class manages sending and receiving of requests from the Scheduler. The FloorSubsystem reads in events using the following format : Time, floor or elevator number, and button. 

Scheduler - This class is the bridge between the Elevator and the Floor systems. It receives request from the FloorSubsystem and also replies to requests from the Elevator when there is work to do.

TestCases - This class is used to run tests on the whole system.

Set Up Instructions: 
To run the system on a computer, the Main method is located in the Floor class : Run > Main as a Java Application
When prompted to input values: Select -> input.txt
When prompted to select a request file: Select -> elevatorInputs.txt



System Flow:
-	Floor requests an elevator and sends it to the scheduler
-	Scheduler decides which elevator to send the request
-	Scheduler relays request to the elevator subsystem
-	Elevator subsystem relays it to the appropriate elevator
-	Elevator that receives the request responds to the scheduler and updates it about it's status

Testing
Run the test cases in Eclipse. On Eclipse: Run > TestCases.java
All Tests should pass.
